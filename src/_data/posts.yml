    India has ambitious renewable energy targets and to achieve this, the country is relying on
    large-scale wind and solar projects. However, small wind (SW) turbines and small wind-solar (SWS)
    hybrids have the potential to meet energy needs through grid-connected and off-grid systems.

    A drought that saw palmyra trees wilting and the ban on toddy tapping in 1987
    made the people of Tharuvaikulam village in Thoothukudi district switch to fishing.
    The villagers decided to adopt sustainable fishing practices, after realising that
